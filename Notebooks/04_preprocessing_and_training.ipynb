    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

    "The way around this is a technique called _cross-validation_. You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "   The first step was to split the data into training and test sets. This ensures that, after a model is trained, the model can be tested on data that it has not seen before. This is important because it helps to verify that the model was not overfit to the training data. 70% of the data was allocated to the training set, the remaining 30% went to the test set. The data was also split into X features (the features that will potentially be used to make predictions) and the y feature (AdultWeekend, the target feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "   The next step was to create a baseline/control model to test all other models against. If a model does not perform better than the baseline model then it is not worth considering. The mean ticket price was used as the baseline model. Using the mean ticket price produced the following results on the training set: R-squared value of 0 (this was expected because using the mean results in an identical numerator and denominator), mean absolute error (MAE) of 17.92, and mean squared error (MSE) of 614.13. The results for the test set were: R-squared of -0.00312, MAE of 19.14, and MSE of 581.44.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   After creating a baseline, “actual” models were created and tested. The first model was a linear regression model. The following steps were used to create the linear regression model: impute missing values, scale features, and train/fit the model (using the training set). The model was then used to predict values for both the training and test sets and the performance was assessed. The Select K Best algorithm was used to determine which features to include in the model. A grid search was used to determine the best value for K. Cross-validation on the training set was used to test the performance for each K-value. It was found that the best eight features from most important to least important were: vertical drop, snow making, total chairs, fast quads, runs, longest run, trams, and skiable terrain. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   A random forest model was also created. A grid search was used to determine which of the following preprocessing steps were best: number of estimators for the random forest regressor, whether or not to use feature scaling, and the best way to impute missing values (mean vs. median). After cross-validation, it was found that the best hyperparameters were 69 estimators, using median for imputation, and not using feature scaling. With this model, it was determined that the best four features from most important to least important were: fast quads, runs, snow making, and vertical drop.\n",

    "   Both models outperformed the baseline model and were, therefore, worth considering. In order to select between models, the cross-validation scores were compared. MAE was used to compare the models. When looking at the cross-validation scores, the random forest model had lower error than the linear model (average MAE of 9.66 vs. 10.5 for the linear model) and lower variability than the linear model (standard deviation among MAE of 1.35 vs. 1.62 for the linear model). This was confirmed when using each model to make predictions on the test set (the random forest model had an MAE of 9.5 while the linear model had an MAE of 11.79). By these metrics, the random forest model performed better than the linear model in cross-validation and on test data. The random forest model exhibited very little variation when comparing cross-validation results to test results. On the other hand, the linear regression model’s test performance was worse by approximately $1.29, when compared to its’ cross-validation results. This greater variation shows that the linear model is likely less reliable. Therefore, the random forest model appears better suited to this problem and should be selected.\n"
